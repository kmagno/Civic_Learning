## Yay, civic learning!
This was a web application developed at the [Hack For Democracy](https://hackfordemocracy.org/) hackathon.

## Installing/Downloading
This application was developed on Python 3.6. After cloning the repo, it is recommended to create a [virtual environment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) then run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can then run the app by going into the `civic_learning_site` directory and running:
```
python manage.py runserver
```
